228,170,2,"Put a few saffron strands in the milk. When you add saffron to warm liquid, in this case milk, it releases flavor and a beautiful yellow color."
229,170,3,Mix well and keep aside till you make the Anjeer Basundi. No Indian sweet is complete without the addition of a spice like saffron.
230,170,4,Pour the full fat milk in a deep non-stick pan. The important thing to remember here is that the milk has to be full fat. The process of making basundi includes thickening the milk over a slow flame and this will only be possible with full fat milk. This process is similar to that of Rabdi. 
231,170,5,Add the sugar to the milk. We are only using 2 tbsps of sugar here because this is an anjeer basundi. The dried figs we are going to use are also very sweet in nature and hence that eliminates the need to add more sugar here.
232,170,6,Mix well and heat both these things over a high flame. We are doing this to bring the milk to a boil. This is should take approximately 5 minutes and it is to be stirred occasionally. The quality and the thickness of the pan really matters here as you do not want the milk to burn and brown at the bottom of the pan.
233,170,7,"Reduce the heat to a low-medium flame and cook for 15 to 17 minutes, while stirring occasionally and while scrapping the sides of the pan. This step is essential to the Anjeer basundi recipe because the malai stuck to the pan provides the thickness and consistency we desire in the basundi."
234,170,8,"Once the milk is reduced by half, add the anjeer pieces. Only dried figs should be used to make the basundi as fresh figs will result in the milk curdling."
235,170,9,Also add saffron-milk mixture which we had kept aside previously. The milk would’ve gotten a yellow color by now.
236,170,10,Add the cardamom powder as well. This spice is also very important in making Indian Sweets. Even a little of the powder goes a long way in providing flavor.
237,170,11,"Mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally and scrapping the sides of the pan."

3614,2432,3,"Combine the warm milk and lemon juice in a bowl, mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes. This mixture helps in binding the batter together."
3615,2432,4,"First of all we will combine all the dry ingredients for that, take the plain flour in a deep bowl."
3616,2432,5,Add the cocoa powder. The chocolaty flavour is due to the addition of cocoa powder.

3626,2432,15,Add the chopped dark chocolate to make the loaf chocolatier. Make sure you have the best quality ingredients while making baked goodies.
3627,2432,16,Add the walnuts and mix gently. They give a nice crunch to the Banana Chocolate loaf on baking.

3633,2432,22,"Cool it, loosen the edges using a knife and demould it by inverting the tin over a rack and tap gently to unmould the loaf."
3634,2432,23,Cut into thick slices and serve immediately.

3640,2436,2,"Add the baking powder.It works as a leavening agent that helps the dough to rise well. In any recipe, the amount of baking powder should be used very precisely, as excess baking powder will cause the product to collapse while less baking powder will make it heavy."
3641,2436,3,Then add baking soda. Baking soda is also used as a leavening agent in baking. Baked recipes leavened using baking soda usually have a lighter crumb and show signs of aeration (in form of tiny holes) because of the escape of carbon dioxide.
3642,2436,4,Mix everything together and keep aside.
3643,2436,5,In another bowl take sugar.
3644,2436,6,Add soft butter.
3645,2436,7,"Then whisk well to cream the butter and sugar. When you cream the butter and sugar, it does more than simply combining the two ingredients and making it soft, you’re beating air bubbles and air pockets into it, which is needed for the baking soda and baking powder to work."
3646,2436,8,Creamed butter and sugar is ready. Now add vanilla essence and milk.
3647,2436,9,Then add the chocolate chips.Mix well with a spatula.

			To make the fresh curd recipe, rinse a deep non-stick pan with 2 tbsp of water and simmer it for 2-3 minutes. This is generally done in stainless steel pans but, if you have an old non-stick pan it is advisable to make this extra effort so, that the milk does not burn. If using a stainless steel patila, you can use the same vessel to set the curd.

			Rotate the pan in a clockwise motion, so the water spreads evenly in the pan. This will prevent milk from scorching as the water forms a protective layer between the pan and milk. If the milk scorches, there will be tiny brown bits of burnt milk in the pan. Hence this step is necessary to avoid such a thing.

6137,4240,3,Wash the leaves thoroughly to remove any dirt and dust that might be on them.

6139,4240,5,Take one fresh bunch of coriander.
6140,4240,6,Separate the leaves and the stems. We are only going to use the leaves and the soft stems.
6141,4240,7,Rinse the coriander leaves in water to remove any dirt that might be stuck to them.
6142,4240,8,Roughly chop the leaves. We will need approximately 1/2 cup of chopped coriander leaves for this chaas. Keep aside.

6144,4240,10,Then add the roughly chopped coriander. Coriander combats inflammation and improves bone health.
6145,4240,11,Now add the green chillies to the blender. These might seem unusual but it actually gives a great taste.
6146,4240,12,"Now add the roasted cumin seeds powder. To make the powder, first dry roast the cumin seeds till slightly darkened in color and fragrant. Cool the seeds completely and then grind them into a fine powder. Roasting the seeds gives them extra flavor."

6148,4240,14,Finally add 1/2 cup of the curd.
6149,4240,15,Shut the lid and blend it till smooth. All the leaves will have blended properly and the mixture will be a bright green color.
6150,4240,16,Pour the prepared mixture in a deep bowl. Take a fairly large bowl as we are going to add the rest of the ingredients now and you don’t want it to spill.
6151,4240,17,To the bowl add the remaining 1 1/2 cup of curd and salt. The salt will totally depend on your taste as many like it to have more salt as others don’t like salt at all.
6152,4240,18,Finally add 2 1/2 cups of cold water to the bowl. You can even use room temperature water if you like.
6153,4240,19,Whisk this well so that the curd and water are properly mixed in with the mint-coriander mixture.
6154,4240,20,Pour equal quantities of the chaas into 4 individual glasses and serve immediately.

6171,4261,1,"Put 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in a deep, clean bowl."
6172,4261,2,"To this, add just a little besan."
6173,4261,3,We will now add the cumin seeds. You can even add ajwain in this for a unique taste.
6174,4261,4,"Add the chilli powder, turmeric powder and hing. Since this is a Masala Khakhra, we have added these 3 masalas. You can try and experiment with more masalas like kasuri methi."
6175,4261,5,Add the low-fat milk. You can even use regular milk or avoid milk altogether. But usually Gujarati khakhras do use a little bit of milk in the dough.
6176,4261,6,Now add the oil and salt to taste. The oil will make the khakhra nice and crisp when cooked.
6177,4261,7,Mix all the ingredients together so that the masalas are evenly distributed throughout the flour.
6178,4261,8,"Knead it into a soft dough without using any water. If you are not using any milk, then use water and knead. This dough should be kneaded just like a roti dough but a little harder."
6179,4261,9,Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.
6180,4261,10,Sprinkle a little whole wheat flour on the rolling board.
6181,4261,11,"Take one portion of dough, roll it in between your palms and flatten it on the rolling board."
6182,4261,12,"Using more flour for rolling, roll out the dough into a very thin 175 mm. (7"") diameter circle. Make sure the khakhra is thin or else it will not be crispy."
6183,4261,13,Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) and place the rolled dough onto it.
6184,4261,14,Cook the khakhra on a slow flame till pink spots appear on both the sides. The flame here has to be slow because you do not want the dough to burn.
6185,4261,15,"Continue cooking the khakhra on a slow flame, while pressing with a folded muslin cloth or a khakhra press. The reason we press down on it is to avoid the roti from puffing up."
6186,4261,16,Cook till it turns crisp from both sides till it turns crisp and brown on both sides. Repeat the same steps for the remaining 3 portions of the dough.
6187,4261,17,Cool it completely and serve or store in an air-tight container for 10-12 days.
6188,4264,1,"Heat some oil in a broad non-stick pan, add the onions once it heats up."
6189,4264,2,Also add ginger and garlic for some pungency and extra taste. Both these ingredients pack a punch and essential any Indian preparation. All these ingredients should not be large in size.
6190,4264,3,Sauté all these ingredients together on a medium flame for 2 minutes.
6191,4264,4,Now add the tomatoes to the pan.
6192,4264,5,With this also add the basic Indian spices. First we will add coriander-cumin seeds powder.
6193,4264,6,Then add chilli powder for a kick. Do not use Kashmiri red chilli powder as it will not give you the spiciness but only the color.
6194,4264,7,Finally add turmeric powder and 1 tbsp of water and mix well. The water prevents the masalas from burning while ensuring they cook properly.
6195,4264,8,"Cook all the masalas and tomatoes on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Once it is cooked, switch off the flame and keep it aside."
6196,4264,9,"Take another broad non-stick pan and put the white sauce in it. White sauce (or béchamel) is a basic sauce used mostly in Italian and French cuisines. It is made by cooking fat (butter or oil) with flour, adding milk to it and then cooking till it is thickened."
6197,4264,10,Also add ½ cup of cheese to this.
6198,4264,11,"Mix well and cook on medium flame for 1 minute, while stirring occasionally or till the cheese completely melts. This will give the sauce a thick, creamy texture and a salty taste."
6199,4264,12,"Once the cheese is incorporated completely, add the masala mixture to the sauce. This is the unique part about this dish that it has both western and Indian influences over the flavor."
6200,4264,13,"Also add the boiled macaroni, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally. The macaroni has to be heated up properly, the masala has to mix well and both flavors should combine properly. You don’t need to add salt because the white sauce will already have but you still taste and adjust the seasoning."
6201,4264,14,Pour the prepared mac and cheese into a baking dish.
6202,4264,15,Sprinkle some fresh coriander leaves over the cheese for an Indian touch.
6203,4264,16,Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup of cheese over it evenly. This will give an even layer of cheese on top that will become light brown and bubbly.
6204,4264,17,Bake this in a pre-heated oven at 200°C(400°F) for 10 minutes.
6205,4264,18,Serve hot along with a stuffed cheesy garlic bread.
6206,4271,1,"Heat a broad non-stick pan, add the cashewnuts (kaju) and dry roast on a medium flame for 1 minute. Do keep an eye on the cashews while dry roasting as they tend to brown immediately, which isn’t very pleasing then. Remove them into a big bowl and keep aside."
6207,4271,2,"In the same broad non-stick pan, add the almonds (badam) and dry roast on a medium flame for 1 minute. The skin of the almond is edible but sometimes bitter. Taste first, if it's not too bitter, don't bother removing it as it will add flavour to the recipe. Remove the almonds from the flame, add it to the bowl of cashewnuts and keep aside."
6208,4271,3,"In the same broad non-stick pan, add the pistachios. Choose pistachios that have shells split open at one end. Unopened shells are an indicator of immaturity. Alternatively taste and buy shelled pistachios. Also always store pistachios in the refrigerator as they tend to turn rancid quickly. Dry roast them on a medium flame for 1 minute. Remove the pistachios from the flame, add it to the bowl of cashewnuts and almonds and keep aside."
6209,4271,4,"In the same broad non-stick pan, add the last 2 ingredients for dry roasting i.e. whole cardamom (elaichi) with the shell and whole peppercorns (kalimirch) and dry roast them on a medium flame for 1 minute only. If you don’t have peppercorns in your pantry, you can avoid them. Remove from the flame and add it to the bowl of roasted nuts. "
6210,4271,5,"Cool all the ingredients completely. If the nuts aren’t cooled well, then post grinding, the masala powder might tend to become lumpy and this will decrease its shelf life."
6211,4271,6,Transfer all the ingredients from the bowl to a blender.
6212,4271,7,"Add the sugar. Prefer to use sugar with small crystals than big crystals, just for the reason that it blends well and faster."
6213,4271,8,"Close the lid of the blender and grind all the ingredients into a coarse powder. For grinding try and use a blade which has 3 to 4 prongs preferably. A blade with 2 prongs might not be able to break and grind the whole nuts uniformly. Also do not grind it for too much time. You need a coarse mixture. So the best idea is to start the grinder for about 10 to 15 seconds and put it off. Shake the jar once, restart the process of grinding and repeat the procedure once or twice more till you get the desired result."
6214,4271,9,Open the lid of the grinder and transfer the coarse powder to a big bowl or jar.
6215,4271,10,"Add the nutmeg powder and mix well. Often termed as jaiphal powder, its known for its sleep inducing properties and thus added to masala milk powder. If you don’t have nutmeg powder, you can also add a very small piece of whole nutmeg to the grinding jar at step 8."
6216,4271,11,"Add the rich spice saffron finally and mix well. This is added not only for its pleasing flavour and taste but also for its attractive colour. While you will also have to add saffron when you make masala milk, a small amount of saffron added at this stage in the powder will blend well with other powdered nuts."
