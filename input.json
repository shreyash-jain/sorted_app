Likewise, it is equally important for equity investors to check the return on equity (ROE) of a company before buying its share. ROE depicts the shareholder's value created by the business. No doubt, investors always yearn for companies that deliver high ROEs for a sustained period of time, which is quite challenging to find. But the question is - even if you find such a company, is it enough to buy a business just because it delivers high ROE? Probably, not always. Apart from high ROE, investors need to take growth and barriers to entry aspects into consideration as well.\\\\nThe growth provides a business with the opportunity to achieve high ROE year on year. After all, higher sales growth ultimately translates into higher earnings while keeping costs in check, thereby leading to an increase in ROE. On the other hand, barriers to entry reduce the threat from newer players (competition), thus providing existing companies with better pricing power. Hence, businesses having high ROEs, operating in sectors with a long runway for growth, and enjoying high barriers to entry can be a treat for investors.\\\\nTo test this hypothesis, we have taken companies from the BSE 500 (excluding Banking & Financial firms) reporting an average ROE and ROCE of more than 20 percent in the last five years till March 2020. Next, we have checked their five-year sales and profit growth till March 2020 and filtered those that have delivered less than 7 percent (around the GDP growth rate) sales and profit growth YoY.

Further, with Blue Dart's dedicated fleet being costlier and having fixed routes, customers started choosing other airlines.

Very often the premiums they have paid are as high as Rs1 lakh or more per year, so bearing the loss upfront becomes difficult.\\\\nFor such investors, the middle path of making the policy 'paid-up' is often the best option. Enquire from the insurance company the minimum period for which premiums must be paid. Pay till then and then stop. Thereafter, the policy will continue to exist. The insurance company will deduct its annual charges from the corpus that has accumulated within the policy and keep it alive. The paid-up policy would offer a lower sum assured, but the investor would at least be saved from throwing good money after bad. The advantage of this course of action is that the investor feels he has not lost his money entirely, though if one were to do the math, the first rather than this third option would be optimal.\\\\nAs you can see, once you have entered these high-cost insurance-cum-investment policies, there can be no painless exit.

The insurance company bets that you will not die and is willing to pay your family Rs 10 lakh if you do. If you survive - which we're sure you would really love to - you lose the bet and the insurance company walks away with Rs 2,000. If you win the bet, you know what happens.\\\\nThis goes on over a period of 10, 15, or 20 years, whatever the term of the policy.

The Dalai Lama believes that meditation and prayer have similar benefits. However, my reading of the subject suggests that there are two differences between meditation and prayer. Firstly, meditation is, in general, a more advanced form of concentrating and focusing the mind than prayer. Secondly, whilst prayer has as its focus either a god or a deity, meditation - especially in its more advanced forms - can be about completely blanking out the mind.\\\\nThe recorded origins of meditation are usually traced to the Chinese and Indian civilizations, although it also appears highly likely that people elsewhere in the ancient world had also clocked onto the benefits of this simple but powerful practice. As John Selby says in Seven Masters, One Path: Meditation Secrets from the World's Greatest Teachers (2003):\\\\n\"Several thousands of years ago, among the...the Taoist culture of ancient China, the judging, analytical thinking mind was already correctly identified as the perpetrator not only of our particularly human blessings in life but also of our particularly human curses. They understood clearly that...we humans have gained vast powers to think logically, reflect upon past experiences, and manipulate the world to our advantage. However, because thinking is a past-future function of the mind, we have tended to lose touch with the vital experience of participating spontaneously in the present moment.\\\\nMeditation aims to resolve this 'lost in thought' dilemma as we temporarily distance ourselves from the constant barrage of thoughts from our inner virtual reality, and shift into a deeper consciousness. By learning to calmly watch thoughts flowing through our minds without being attached to those thoughts, we liberate ourselves from chronic identification with our ego's limited notion of what life is all about...In the Taoist tradition, when we quiet our thoughts in meditation, we let go of trying to manipulate the world based on our inner fantasies of how things should be.\"\\\\n"}],"is_for_old":0,"is_relationship":0,"is_food":0,"time_stamp":1612861268539,"id":1612861268539,"tags":["Yoga","Investment","Stress","Meditaion","focus"],"article_title":"Meditation and investing","is_proof_read":0,"num_textbox":6,"image_url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sorted-98c02.appspot.com/o/articles%2F1612861268539%2F1612861268539?alt=media&token=2aebf3b8-2f06-4fc2-94fb-5a8fc11aec74","content_ownership":"Maan Singh","is_career":0,"subCollection":{"articles/1612861268539/textboxes":{"1612861274516":{"content":[{"insert":""},{"attributes":{},"insert":"One legendary investor, Ray Dalio, and another highly successful albeit lesser-known investor, Jason Voss, have written extensively about how meditation has helped them become better investors (Dalio in his book Principles (2016) and Voss in his book The Intuitive Investor (2010).

The reverse counting is a way of distracting my ego and thus letting the mind enter a more relaxed mode. Practicing this technique on a daily basis for even ten minutes allows you to gain control of your mind to such an extent that soon you will be able to meditate at a time and a place of your choosing.\\\\nThe more advanced formats involve concentrating on one or more long sessions (of an hour or more) each day. This often involves chanting as the technique being used to distract the egoic mind.

Photography was a new and exciting medium at the time. Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody could figure out how to print images quickly and cheaply.\\\\nFor example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s, they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used to press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses. This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time consuming and expensive.\\\\nThe man who invented a solution to this problem was named Frederic Eugene Ives.

The notion that sequences of real events possess the formal attributes of the stories we tell about imaginary events could only have its origin in wishes, daydreams, reveries.

Volunteers given no caffeine showed no increase in brain activity.\\\\nAnother study, published in a leading neurology journal, found that the effects of caffeine may be longer-lasting in women. This four-year-long study involved about 7,000 participants who all went through baseline evaluations for cognitive function and blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other vascular issues.\\\\nThe researchers reevaluated the participants at the end of two years and again at the end of four years; they found that women 65 and older who drank more than three cups of coffee per day (or the caffeine equivalent in tea) had about a third less decline in memory over that time than the women who drank one cup or less of coffee (or the caffeine equivalent in tea) per day.\\\\nThe results held up even after the researchers adjusted them to take into account other factors that could affect memory function, such as age, education, baseline cognitive function, depression, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, medications, and chronic illnesses. The researchers speculated that this caffeine-memory association was not observed in men because it’s possible that the sexes metabolize caffeine differently.\\\\nOne thing to keep in mind, though, is that unfiltered coffee (such as espresso, as well as coffee made in a French press) contains compounds that can raise cholesterol levels, especially in people who are already battling high cholesterol.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is the most common preventable risk factor for heart disease (1Trusted Source). Over 1 billion people around the world have high blood pressure, which is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (the top number) of 130 mm Hg or more, diastolic blood pressure (DBP, the bottom number) of more than 80 mm Hg, or both (2Trusted Source). Medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are commonly used to reduce blood pressure levels. However, lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications, can help lower blood pressure levels to optimal ranges and reduce your risk of heart disease. Following a nutritious, heart-healthy diet is suggested for all people with high blood pressure, including those on blood-pressure-lowering medications (1Trusted Source). A healthy diet is essential for lowering blood pressure and maintaining optimal levels, and research has shown that including certain foods in your diet, especially those high in specific nutrients like potassium and magnesium, reduces your blood pressure levels \\\\n"}],"base_content_word_count":187,"summary":"A healthy diet is essential for lowering blood pressure and maintaining optimal levels, and research has shown that including certain foods in your diet, especially those high in specific nutrients like potassium and magnesium, reduces your blood pressure levels\nLycopene has been significantly associated with beneficial effects on heart health, and eating foods high in this nutrient, such as tomato products, may help reduce heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure (25Trusted Source","is_career":0,"is_for_old":0,"is_proof_read":0,"content_ownership":"","is_for_professional":0,"is_relationship":0,"article_web_link":"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-blood-pressure","id":1613072558041,"time_stamp":1613072558041,"article_title":"Best Foods for High Blood Pressure","is_mental_health":0,"is_fitness":0,"is_productivity":0,"keywords":["included","blood","trusted","pressure","source","lowered","levels","studies","people","nutrient","intakes","potassium","chard","compounds","carrot","acids","magnesium","medications","heart","vessels"],"subCollection":{"articles/1613072558041/textboxes":{"1613072561069":{"id":1613072561069,"word_count":117,"heading":"Citrus fruits","imageUrl":"","content":[{"insert":""},{"insert":"\\\\n","attributes":{"heading":2}},{"insert":"Citrus fruits","attributes":{"a":"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/citrus-fruit-benefits"}},{"insert":", including grapefruit, oranges, and lemons, may have powerful blood-pressure-lowering effects.

Social skills, and listening in particular, are no different.\\\\nFeedback is an important mechanism for practice. You try something, you get a response, and you use that response to adjust your output for next time. I’m describing this as a mechanical process, but really it mostly takes place unconsciously. Motor skills like walking and throwing a ball likely also use some kind of feedback in this way, albeit not at a conscious level.\\\\nThe challenge with improving your understanding of the mental states of others is the problem of subtext. People rarely say directly what they mean. This means, when you make a social misstep, diagnosing what you did wrong may not be obvious. This is compounded by the fact that, if you’re bad at reading minds, you’ll also be bad at processing social feedback.\\\\nThis is a tough bootstrapping problem and something similar occurs in other areas of learning. You don’t know what you don’t know, so even diagnosing your problems at first can be difficult.\\\\nOne way I’ve seen a lot of people try to deal with this is to first learn a lot of theory. That is, if they could only make explicit all the common subtext they’re dealing with, they would be able to more easily consciously diagnose their mistakes. This is particularly prevalent in dating advice for men with poor social skills.\\\\nThe problem with this approach is twofold. First, grand theories of social skills are often wrong. We don’t understand social skills nearly as well as other human fields, so basing your opinions on some well-articulated theory of hidden motivations may have a lot of mistakes. This doesn’t mean theorizing is useless, just that it isn’t an infallible guide for practical benefits.\\\\nThe second problem is that subtext is usually implicit for a good reason. People do have hidden motives and unconscious behavior, yes. But dealing with those hidden motives consciously doesn’t usually win you friends and allies. Treating what is implicit as explicit is a sign of social ineptitude itself, so doing this step of conversion deliberately often ends up with worse outcomes at first, rather than better ones.\\\\nThe theory-driven approach to learning to understand other people is often like trying to understand art by having detailed models of the chemistry of paint.

Being generally more intelligent on every possible task is we’re not even sure can be done.\\\\nI think the same is true of social skills. If you have very poor social skills, you can definitely still learn to master particular social habits and skills.

You may even become excellent in some narrow specializations of social skills like public speaking, negotiating, or having a good relationship.\\\\nHowever, it's likely that even with serious practice, there may be novel social situations where you’re a bit slower than someone who is more naturally gifted. But that’s totally fine! The fact that there may be some fixed parts of ability at some deeper level shouldn’t negate the possibility of meaningful improvement at other levels.\\\\nI know that I’m probably not going to reach perfect levels of social skills.

It is true that children learn emotion regulation skills from their parents. You have the ability to teach your child how to manage emotions rather than become overwhelmed by them.\\\\nYour child also needs to know that they can reach out to you for help and comfort when needed. Having a supportive and reliable parent figure in their life will help to protect them against problems with emotional dysregulation.\\\\nThe first thing you can do is to recognize your own limitations. Do you have a mental disorder or have you struggled with your own emotion regulation skills? If so, you and your child might benefit from you receiving treatment or therapy to build up your own resilience. When you are better able to manage your own distress, then you will be able to offer the most support to your child.\\\\nIn addition, the best way to teach your child how to manage their emotions is not to demand that they behave in a certain way or punish them for acting out. Rather, the best option is to model the desired behavior yourself that you want them to adopt.\\\\nIt can be helpful to start to recognize triggers for your child's behavior and have a back-up plan of effective ways to deal with acting out. For example, if your child always has a tantrum when you take them to buy shoes, try picking out a pair in their size and bringing them home for them to try on.\\\\nChildren who struggle with emotion dysregulation benefit from predictability and consistency. Your child needs to know that you will be there for them when they need you and that they can rely on you to be the calming presence. When your own emotions are out of control, then it is much more likely that your child will be unable to manage their own emotions.\\\\nIf your child is in school, it is also important that you talk to their teacher about their problems with emotion regulation. Talk about the strategies that you use at home and how your child might need extra help in the classroom or reminders on how to calm down. If your child has a diagnosed disorder, they may be on a special education plan that allows accommodations or gives them extra help. Be sure to take advantage of that.\\\\nFinally, it's important to reward positive behavior. If you see your child acting in ways that are positive for emotion management, comment on those positive behaviors. Find ways to reward emotion management successes, so that they will become more frequent.\\\\n"}],"imageUrl":"","heading":"Parenting a Child with Emotion Dysregulation","subCollection":{}}}}},"1613926722228":{"is_productivity":0,"image_url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sorted-98c02.appspot.com/o/articles%2F1613926722228%2F1613926722228?alt=media&token=5430b8fb-7217-4918-a36f-6565d865b157","base_content":[{"insert":""},{"insert":"Cognitive and "},{"attributes":{"a":"https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cognitive-behavior-therapy-2795747"},"insert":"cognitive-behavioral"},{"insert":" approaches have come to dominate "},{"attributes":{"a":"https://www.verywellmind.com/psychotherapy-4157172"},"insert":"psychotherapy"},{"insert":", but the emotions babies have from birth may offer alternative forms of therapy.

This kind of parenting is also correlated with more aggression, hostility, and disruptive behavior on the part of children.\\\\n\\\\nThis kind of behavior in children is also linked to less optimal academic performance. The hypothesis with the strongest evidence to explain this is the adjustment erosion hypothesis; it holds that impulsivity, hostility, and other such behaviors disrupt learning.

An alternative hypothesis – that academic incompetence comes first and leads to disruptive behavior — is not backed as strongly by evidence, especially in the early school years.

Given this reality, it’s understandable that many women develop a negative attitude about romantic relationships. As a result, I often I hear divorced women say things such as, “I hate dating,” and “there are no good men left.” This view point will negatively impact, if not sabotage, any effort to find new love. It’s overall bad energy.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re feeling stuck in negative emotions such as anger and resentment, my suggestion is that you first commit to the on-going work of developing a more positive and open mindset, what world-renowned Stanford University psychologist and author Carol Dweck describes as a “growth mindset.” Simply put, a growth mindset is the willingness to embrace our challenges as opportunities for change and growth. Furthermore, Dweck states that true healing can only occur when we are in this mindset.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, if despite your efforts, you find that you are unable to make this shift on your own, seek out professional help such as a therapist and/or a coach, develop a yoga and mindfulness practice, and emerge yourself in a supportive environment with like-minded people and uplifting content (books, audios, podcasts, etc.) In addition to feeling better in your everyday life, your experience of dating will be radically different.\\\\n"}],"id":1614343103215,"word_count":257,"heading":"DEVELOP A POSITIVE “DATING MINDSET”","subCollection":{}},"1614343103216":{"heading":"CLOSE THE EX-FILES","content":[{"insert":""},{"insert":"One of the best pieces of dating advice I ever heard was – don’t talk about your ex on a first date, because once you start you may not know when to stop!

There are many reasons not to open up the ex-files in the early stages of dating. Firstly, the early stages of dating are meant to develop a positive connection between you and your date.

When you bring up an ex, you risk creating distance by putting the thought of you with your ex into the mind of your date.\\\\n\\\\nSo when is it okay to discuss your ex? Here are a few guidelines to follow. First off, if you can, wait a few dates to share intimately personal details, so your date will not feel threatened or put off. Secondly, speak about your past relationship and your ex-partner as positively as possible. Speaking negatively about your ex, may only serve to reflect poorly on you. Lastly, make sure anything you share about an ex fits the context and flow of your conversation. It can be terribly awkward to have someone unnaturally insert information about an ex. Depending on what stage you’re at in your recovery after a divorce, it’s completely understandable that you may feel a need to talk or vent – but that’s what girlfriends, and therapists, and breakup coaches are for!

But if arguing your point doesn’t make you happy, what’s the point of having to be right all the time?\\\\n\\\\nLook to see the humor in a situation when your opinions and perceptions are shown to be different. Research has shown that our brains can perceive a situation in hundreds of different ways – so it really is a miracle that we understand each other and agree on anything at all!\\\\n\\\\nKnowing in advance that your brain is often going to misinterpret things, (as well as the intentions behind them) you can choose to see the humor of a situation instead of taking a resistant stance and stubbornly trying to prove that you are right. Technically, both of you are right from your own perspectives, so make it a priority that you seek to understand what your partner is trying to say and convey.\\\\n\\\\nOften, you will find yourself starting to smile at the absurdity of a resistant stance you are taking but, you can’t seem to help yourself from indulging in being stubborn. You clearly see what your partner is trying to say, however, you are too invested in proving that their words are wrong and inconsistent with what they’re meaning to say. You’re too busy proving yourself right that you don’t correct this relationship sabotaging action before it escalates out of control. Overindulging in this childish game can lead to either or both of you becoming emotionally triggered and entering a full-blown argument… Just because you wanted to prove that you were right.\\\\n\\\\nStop being petty and instead, choose to enjoy your different modes of expression. This will help prevent issues from escalating out of control and is a major step toward saving your marriage. The good news is when you stop overreacting from a negatively triggered emotion, you will feel happier. And it’s a wonderful thing to choose to be happy rather than being right all the time. Hence, an effective method of saving a marriage that is falling apart.\\\\n\\\\nUsing humor and stopping being petty are effective ways to cope with small problems in a marriage and dating coach Matthew Hussey agrees with that.

Yes, I understand that saving a marriage is paramount in most cases, but not every marriage should be saved. It can be more important to save your sanity when compatibility and chemistry are both absent in your marriage.\\\\n\\\\nCompatibility means you and your spouse have the same, similar or compatible value systems which can improve communication in your relationship. Let me explain.\\\\n\\\\nIf both you and your spouse love reading books on personal development, that means you probably have similar values, i.e. knowledge and self-improvement.\\\\nAnother example of having similar value systems is you like cooking and your spouse loves wine – both of you value the foodie culture.\\\\nAs to compatible value systems, that can be something like you love writing and your spouse loves movies. In this situation, when you are writing, your spouse can be watching movies. You don’t necessarily have to do the same or similar activities together, but your interest doesn’t negatively affect your spouse’ interest.\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, many couples have incompatible value systems. For example, a highly spiritual, health conscious, ethical person with no interest in football being married to a partying atheist who drinks a lot of alcohol and spends most of their spare time frequenting bars and watching football. As time goes by, resentment can build, as they have little shared interests to talk about.\\\\n\\\\nAs for chemistry, I know I’ve mentioned that you can improve intimacy in the bedroom. Yes, most people can work on their intimacy skills in the bedroom and rekindle their passion as well as a happy and healthy relationship. But no one can guarantee that 100% of married couples will act to restore a happy and satisfying sex life. This may be due to one partner refusing to get help due to feelings of embarrassment.\\\\n\\\\nIf your partner is not willing or able to step up to fulfill you, this will eventually affect your level of emotional connection and desire for this person.
